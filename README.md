# DDSMUtility_Modifed
A modified file in DDSMUtility (https://github.com/trane293/DDSMUtility)

I would like to appreciate the extraction codes for the DDSM database in (https://github.com/trane293/DDSMUtility).
These codes was properly working in MATLAB 2015.
I modified one matlab file 'openDDSMLJPEGAndConvertToPNG.m' to make it runs in MATLAB 2018.
