# DDSMUtility (Modifed)
A modified file in DDSMUtility (https://github.com/trane293/DDSMUtility) is included here.

I would like to appreciate the extraction codes for the DDSM database in (https://github.com/trane293/DDSMUtility).

These codes was properly working in MATLAB 2015.

I modified one matlab file 'openDDSMLJPEGAndConvertToPNG.m' to make it run in MATLAB 2018.

Please just copy and paste the modified file.
